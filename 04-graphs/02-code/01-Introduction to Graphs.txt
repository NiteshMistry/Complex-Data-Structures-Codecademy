Introduction to Graphs

Vertex stores some data.
Vertex stores the edges to connected vertices and their weight.
Vertex can add a new edge to its collection.
Graph stores all the vertices.
Graph knows if it is directed or undirected.
Graph can add a new vertex to its collection.
Graph can add a new edge between stored vertices.
Graph can tell whether a path exists between stored vertices.
